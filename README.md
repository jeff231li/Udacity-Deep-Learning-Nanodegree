# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree
This repository contains my project submission for the Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity.

# Projects
* [Predicting bike-sharing patterns](Project-1): Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.
* [Landmark Classifier](Project-2): Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify images of landmarks.
* [TV Script Generation](Project-3): Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue 
  from Seinfeld.
* [Face Generation](Project-4): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.
* [Sentiment Analysis](Project-5): deploy a sentiment analysis model with Amazon SageMaker
